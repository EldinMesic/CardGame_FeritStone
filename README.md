# CardGame_FeritStone
Card game based on Hearthstone made as a side project in my 3rd year of college.

Made in Unity and coded using C#. 

All the card data and info is held on a remote database which allows me to dynamically change card data and add new cards without the need of a new game installation. 

The Installer provided here also serves as a full game updater in case some major problems or new ideas show up.
